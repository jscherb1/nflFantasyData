# nflFantasyData
The project is used to collect NFL statistics and structure the data for analysis in another tool (Power BI/Tableau)

# Questions to Answer
The ultimate questions that I want to answer through analysis are:
  - who should I target in trades?
  - Who should I start this week?
  
Other questions:
  - Who has performed the most consistently? (weekly rankings by position)
  - Who is trending up and down?
  - Who has had a bye already?


# Future Enhancements / questions
  - Get player forecasts
  - Add in defensive ranks
  - Who has the easiest schedule remaining?
